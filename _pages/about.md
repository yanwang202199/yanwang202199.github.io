Dr. Yan Wang is a research assistant professor at the Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University. 

Before joining AIR, he was a senior researcher and team leader at SenseTime, where he and his team focus on research and product development in the fields of object detection, model compression and data compression powered by AI. 

He has extensive interdisciplinary knowledge and research experience in the fields of artificial intelligence, parameter estimation, computational fluid dynamics and public safety (this is a interdisciplinary field but more about engineering, where we combine the knowledge and techniques of physics, chemistry, computer simulation and AI to conduct risk analysis, disaster monitoring and prediction, as well as emergency disposal).

His current research includes data compression powered by AI, perception in intelligent transportation and neural network compression. 

He is also interested in generative models, and the connection between deep learning and information theory, both of which are closely related to compression.
