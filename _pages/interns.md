I used to be a team leader at SenseTime, where I gain a solid experience on working with full-time researchers and young students.

Opening research directions (although listed as different topics here, we always try to solve key problems in various fields through some common principles and techniques, for example, by investigating self-supervised learning, probabilistic inference or the general principle of information compression)：   

(1) Neural data compression: efficient and effective model design, Neural sandwiched/augmented x264/5  

(2) Neural data compression: principled approaches and theoretical aspects, information theory  

(3) Generative model: from theory to application  

(4) Autonomous driving: perception, prediction, planning, V2X, etc    

(5) AI + (safety) Science. I keep close collaboration with School of Safety Science, Tsinghua University        

We have Postdoc and PhD positions (supervised by Prof. Ya-Qin Zhang), feel free to contact me by wangyan202199@163.com  

多歧路，今安在？  
知乎、小红书同号：压缩即智能     

我们的目标是做一流的科学研究，发表高水平论文，扩展认知边界，推动前沿技术落地和产业进步   
同时我们有丰富的产业界工作经验，落地过多项前沿AI算法和产品，熟悉AI产品从预研、开发到销售的整个流程   
无论你毕业后的目标是学术界还是工业界，相信在这里都会有所收获

ps: 我们会优先从有合作经历、互相了解的学生中选择博士生，如果可能，尽量提前来实习~  

实习生要求具备深度学习的算法和编程基础，能够自主进行文献阅读和算法实现。最重要的，对上述数据压缩、生成模型和自动驾驶等相关方向感兴趣   

也欢迎其他形式的学术合作
